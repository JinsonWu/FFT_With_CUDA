******Announcement******
*The cuda environment is established on Visual Studio in Windows10 because the default VB doesn't support the complex function.
*nvcc in VB shows that the function elements are not incuded inside the compiler, thus I compile kernel.cu (main.cu) in VB to verify the correctness of FFT function.
*As for cuda implementation, I use Visual Studio 2019 in Windows 10 to successfully run the project.

*******Steps and File Explanation*********
1. kernel.cu is the main.cu of either FFT_method1 or FFT_method2
2. FFT_GPU_methodx.cu is the cuda file of each project, which includes the cuda-intended functions and definition of cuda elements.
3. parameters.h includes callees using in kernel.cu and FFT_GPU_methodx.cu
4. re.wav is a 25-second NCS audio file, which is the source audio arrays.
5. result_methodx.dat stores the final output of complex arrays after FFT processing.
6. to handle complex in cuda functions, it's necessary to inlcude "--expt-relaxed-countpr" in cuda common lines to make complex arrays available to be modified.
7. The solution is built, and what you have to do is open the solution file and press the "Local Windows Debugger" button.
8. If there is a problem, please watch the demo video to make sure everything is on the right track.
